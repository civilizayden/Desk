# Desk
This project is a standing desk based on the Flexispot E5 frame. The desktop is made of melamine coated chipboard, which I got cut at home depot. I drilled the holes and attached it to the desktop. After that, I got some melamine edge banding (see BOM), and ironed it onto the edges.  ![IMG_4809](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12e0d34a-bee4-491e-b410-b9bf1869ce21)

I also added many 3D printed parts, including a cable chain, a pegboard mount, and (not added yet) an under-desk cable management system. I also attached two monitor arms, one of which could hold two monitors, for a total of 3 mounted monitors.  
The part that I am most proud of is the PC mount. It would not fit on the desk, so it had to go underneath. I used some webbing and clips to make a custom "mount", which was basically just wrapped around the frame of the desk and my computer to hold it in place for the up and down motion of the desk.   ![IMG_4811](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2713e76-87e0-4426-b574-37cebec36799)

Another part that didn't seen like it would be a problem at first was the speakers. I wanted my subwoofer (which acts as a hub for the speakers) to be in the corner of my room. That meant that the rightmost speaker could not reach across the desk and down the cable chain to attach to the sub. Easy fix, just extend the cable right? Wrong. There is a proprietary 14ish pin connecter made by a company no longer in buisness preventing me from doing so because of the volume knobs on the right speaker. However, the left speaker ends with an RCA cable, which can be easily extended. So, I swapped the right and left speakers on the desktop and extended the farthest one (technically the left but I put it on the right) to reach. However, I now had backwards sound. The sound that should be coming from the right now comes from the left, which means I am hosed because there is no easy way to swap the left and right audio channels in Windows. Thankfully, I was able to find Equalizer APO, which let me do just that. Now all I had to do was cable management and patching holes in the wall and then I was done.

Another major part of the build was cable management. I 3D printed a cable chain and used the OpenGrid ecosystem to plan and 3D print cable tracks on the bottom of the desk to perfectly organize every cable. I used the opengrid generator to make the grids and the underware for opengrid system for the tracks. It is all found on makerworld, and the links are in my Desk Prints.csv file.
