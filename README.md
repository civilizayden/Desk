# Desk
This project is a standing desk based on the Flexispot E5 frame. The desktop is made of melamine coated chipboard, which I got cut at home depot. I drilled the holes and attached it to the desktop. After that, I got some melamine edge banding (see BOM), and ironed it onto the edges.  ![IMG_4809](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12e0d34a-bee4-491e-b410-b9bf1869ce21)

I also added many 3D printed parts, including a cable chain, a pegboard mount, and (not added yet) an under-desk cable management system. I also attached two monitor arms, one of which could hold two monitors, for a total of 3 mounted monitors.  
The part that I am most proud of is the PC mount. It would not fit on the desk, so it had to go underneath. I used some webbing and clips to make a custom "mount", which was basically just wrapped around the frame of the desk and my computer to hold it in place for the up and down motion of the desk.   ![IMG_4811](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2713e76-87e0-4426-b574-37cebec36799)

Another part that didn't seen like it would be a problem at first was the speakers. I wanted my subwoofer (which acts as a hub for the speakers) to be in the corner of my room. That meant that the rightmost speaker could not reach across the desk and down the cable chain to attach to the sub. Easy fix, just extend the cable right? Wrong. There is a proprietary 14ish pin connecter made by a company no longer in buisness preventing me from doing so because of the volume knobs on the right speaker. However, the left speaker ends with an RCA cable, which can be easily extended. So, I swapped the right and left speakers on the desktop and extended the farthest one (technically the left but I put it on the right) to reach. However, I now had backwards sound. The sound that should be coming from the right now comes from the left, which means I am hosed because there is no easy way to swap the left and right audio channels in Windows. Thankfully, I was able to find Equalizer APO, which let me do just that. Now all I had to do was cable management and patching holes in the wall and then I was done.

Another major part of the build was cable management. I 3D printed a cable chain and used the OpenGrid ecosystem to plan and 3D print cable tracks on the bottom of the desk to perfectly organize every cable. I used the opengrid generator to make the grids and the underware for opengrid system for the tracks. It is all found on makerworld, and the links are in my Desk Prints.csv file.

# How to Build
If you want to build this desk, here's what you need to do. I am assuming you have gotten all of the materials from the BOM.csv. You will need a drill, an iron (like for clothes), and an electric screwdriver. First, get your wood cut to size. I would reccomend getting melamine coated chipboard from Home Depot, as they can cut it for you. Get a desk size that fits your space.  
  
After you have all of that, you will want to assemble the frame. Follow the instructions that come with the desk frame, (mine was the Flexispot E5), and then pre-drill holes. You want to follow the diagram in the instructions to figure out which holes to use based on your desk size. Once you know, set the frame to the correct distance and place it on top of your desktop, preferably on carpet. Pre-drill the holes using a 3/32 bit with your drill in the spaces indicated in the instructions. After you have it pre-drilled, use the electric screwdriver to screw the desktop to the frame.  

After you have the desktop attached, right the desk and begin ironing on the melamine edge banding. I would reccomend securing waxpaper on the iron to avoid melting the edge banding onto your iron and to avoid burning the banding. Start with a slight overlap so you can cut it cleanly on the edge. When you get to an edge, cut it clean with a knife. Continue this for all four sides until you are done. Do not try to bend the edge banding around the corners, it is better to simply cut it and have it slightly overlap on an edge.  

This next part is for if you want the cable management. Decide if you need it on the entire underside or only on the rear half. Measure the area in which you need it and use this OpenGrid planner to figure out how many baseplates you need: https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/b929de6b-a443-48e1-8641-5ffc1b882257  
Then input those into this baseplate generator with the specifications you want, and print them up: https://makerworld.com/en/models/1304337-opengrid-tile-generator  
After those are printed, you can plan out where you want to route cables (I reccomend using graph paper) and figure out what you need to print. I used these models: https://makerworld.com/en/models/1175037-underware-for-opengrid?from=search  

This is for securing the computer to the underside of the desk. Note: This may not work for all computers based on the spacing of the power cords and such. Prop up the computer high enough above the ground (using books) that the desk frame touches it when you lower the standing desk. Next, wrap the webbing around the computer and slide it into the small groove seperating the desktop and the frame. Cut the webbing a little long, and then thread it into the clips included with the webbing. Do this again for the other side (just compare the legnths and cut it the same) and then adjust the clips until they just barely fit (you want it tight so that it doesn't fall off). Wrap the reamining webbing around the desk leg, attach another clip, and secure the computer to the frame.  

Have fun with your new desk! Add any cable management you need and whatever else to make it yours. I added 2 speakers, an ikea pegboard, 3 28" monitors @70ish hz, and a mic arm.
